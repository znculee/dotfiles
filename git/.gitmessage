# -- Scope --
# The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.
#

# -- Subject --
# The subject contains a succinct description of the change
# use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# don't capitalize first letter
# no dot (.) at the end
#

# -- Body --
# Just as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not
# "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the
# change and contrast this with previous behavior.
#

# -- Footer --
# The footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also
# the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes. Breaking
# Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two
# newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
